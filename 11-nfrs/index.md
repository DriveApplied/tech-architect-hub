Welcome to the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) section of the Enterprise Architect Hub. This section focuses on various "ility" requirements and other non-functional aspects that are crucial in architectural design. Explore these subsections to gain insights into different NFR areas:

## performance

Discover strategies for optimizing system performance to meet NFRs related to speed, responsiveness, and efficiency. Learn how to conduct load testing and performance tuning to ensure your systems perform at their best.

## scalability

Explore architectural approaches for designing scalable systems that can grow with increasing demands. Learn about scaling strategies, horizontal vs. vertical scaling, and elasticity to meet scalability NFRs.

## availability

Learn about architectural considerations to ensure high availability of systems. Explore concepts like redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery to meet availability NFRs.

## reliability

Dive into architectural practices for building reliable systems that minimize downtime and errors. Understand how redundancy, fault tolerance, and error handling contribute to reliability NFRs.

## security

Address security-related NFRs, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and security best practices. Explore how security architecture and threat modeling play a crucial role in meeting security NFRs.

## maintainability

Discover architectural strategies for creating maintainable systems that are easy to update, enhance, and troubleshoot. Explore practices like modularity and code maintainability to meet maintainability NFRs.

## usability

Explore architectural considerations for creating user-friendly and intuitive systems. Learn about user experience design and usability testing to meet usability NFRs effectively.

## interoperability

Understand architectural approaches for ensuring interoperability with other systems and technologies. Explore standards, protocols, and integration patterns to meet interoperability NFRs.

## portability

Learn about architectural practices for building portable systems that can run on various platforms and environments. Explore containerization and virtualization to meet portability NFRs.

## compliance

Explore architectural considerations related to regulatory and compliance requirements. Understand how to design systems that adhere to industry standards and legal obligations to meet compliance NFRs.

## observability

Discover architectural strategies for enhancing observability, monitoring, and debugging of systems. Learn how to gain insights into system behavior to meet observability NFRs.
